# Capstone RC Control Website

Open up [the website](https://mrgorbunov.github.io/CapstoneRCControlWebsite/).

### Note
For this to work, you _need_ to disable security for this one page. To do in chrome, click the little lock next to the url
in the search bar, go to device settings, and then enable **Insecure Content**.

The reason for this is because the Java server at home is HTTP, while the github page is HTTPS. By default, browsers disable 
HTTPS websites from sending requests to HTTP. Enabling insecure content will allow for pinging the HTTP server.
